## The Multiplatform Linux Sandbox
DetuxNG is a malware sandbox developed for daily use by analysts.  Based on QEMU and using SSH for system control, DetuxNG can support environments of multiple architectures (x86, x64, ARM, MIPS, etc) and operating systems (windows, linux, android).  

DetuxNG is not designed for enterprise use. 


### Introduction:
DetuxNG is a sandbox developed to do magic


### Setup:

1: Create Virtual Machines
 - Bash scripts will do net installs
 - power off vm
 - take snapshot

Detux requires specific machine name format

(Win10):
    Enable SSH server
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse
    https://winaero.com/enable-openssh-server-windows-10/
    
2: Verify working
 - virsh list --all              # List VMs
 - virsh net-dhcp-leases default # Get IPs of hosts

3: Auto-generate config?
